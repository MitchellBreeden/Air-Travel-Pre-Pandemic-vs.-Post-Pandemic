Data needed:  
Flights: https://zenodo.org/record/6078268/files/flightlist_20200301_20200331.csv.gz?download=1  
Airlines: http://www.lsv.fr/~sirangel/teaching/dataset/airlines.txt  
Airports: http://www.lsv.fr/~sirangel/teaching/dataset/airports.txt  
Aircrafts: http://www.lsv.fr/~sirangel/teaching/dataset/aircrafts.txt  

For Airlines, Airports and Aircrafts the author used \N to signify null values but this is read as new line in python. To fix this we opened each file in text edit and replaced all \N with N/A.  

Once the required packages are installed and all data is collected, click run all cells in jupyter and explore our analysis!
